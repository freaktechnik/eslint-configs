# eslint-plugin-freaktechnik

Basic configurations freaktechnik really likes. They are pretty opinionated and other people will probably find them disgusting. Don't forget to add `--ext json,js` to your eslint invocation.

Configurations are published under the @freaktechnik namespace. A consolidated version is available for legacy reasons as `eslint-plugin-freaktechnik`.

## Configurations
